## General guidelines for contributing code

You are very welcome to contribute to the project! Pull requests welcome, as well as issues or plain messages.

Respect the below and I will be happy to merge your work and credit you for it.

### Style and structure

- Follow the style and conventions already in place. Figmagic uses Typescript and attempts to do some sort of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
- _As always, write clean, easy-to-read code. Prefer being slightly more verbose and semantic than being "efficient" and terse_, if such a choice is necessary. Write as if someone is going to contribute on top of your code base tomorrow without knowing you or your work.
- Follow importing by highest-level components at top, and detail-oriented components at bottom. Example:

```
import { FRAME as Frame } from '../../../contracts/Figma';
import { BorderWidthTokens } from '../../../contracts/Tokens';

import { makeBorderWidthTokens } from '../index';

import { camelize } from '../../../frameworks/string/camelize';

import {
  ErrorMakeBorderWidthTokensNoFrame,
  ErrorMakeBorderWidthTokensNoChildren,
  ErrorMakeBorderWidthTokensMissingProps
} from '../../../frameworks/errors/errors';
```

1. Entities
2. Contracts
3. Use cases or other high-level files
4. Same-level files
5. Frameworks
6. Messages, errors, warnings (separated)

### Tests

- **Always include tests for additions or changes**. Aim for 100% coverage, but set a minimum bar to cover at least the main functionality. Figmagic should ideally have total code coverage of 95% or more. Your contribution will affect that score, so aim to keep it high(er)! :)
- It's encouraged to place any test data in the `__tests__/testdata/` folder.
- **Always check that all tests (including your new ones) are passing before making a pull request**.
- _With the current GitHub Actions setup, your build there will fail since there is no access to my NPM credentials for non-master branches. Don't be alarmed!_ Again, ensure tests are passing and I can easily verify it in the build output.

### Mocking Requests

- **Always mock your requests**. This is a good way to test your code without having to actually make a request to the API and avoid dependance on a realtime response.
- Place mock data in the `__tests__/mocks/` folder.
- Mocked requests are defined in the `__tests__/mocks/handlers.ts` file, using the [msw](https://mswjs.io/) api.
- For local development purposes, mocking can be enabled / disabled in the `jest.env.js` file changing the `IS_MOCK_ENABLED` environment variable, disabling it will make the tests run against the real API.

### Error handling

- Make sure to handle errors and do any relevant validation logic. Also always output meaningful, actionable messages/warnings/errors to the user.
- Avoid inlining messages, errors or warnings. Instead place those in the dedicated files for each of the mentioned concerns, and read them from there.

### Documentation

- Document your code with JSDoc at the start of your code. Since Figmagic uses Typescript, add "description" documentation; more than that is not needed.
- Add any inline comments as needed for anything that is not self-evident.
- Update the README with any user-facing changes, such as new CLI commands or arguments.
